How To Play?
The game simply aims to protect the element bubble on the left. While protecting the element bubble, you must not pass any element that is not the same as it. For example, if you are protecting the water bubble, you should only allow the water element to pass. The emojis of the bubbles change depending on their health. If their health decreases too much, they will die or leave you.

In order to destroy the incoming element mobs, you must select the element that is their counter.

You can move with the W A S D keys, attack with the space key, use the mouse to change the element on your staff from the UI or by using the 1 2 3 4 5 6 keys. The elements that counter each other are as follows:

Fire - Water

Air - Earth

Light - Darkness

For example, if a dark element mob is coming, you should turn your staff to light and hit it. Likewise, if the light element is coming, you should turn your wand to darkness and hit.

More than half of the game's pixel art and the music was created during the jam. Ofc there are some assets that we yoinked. I hope you enjoy! Because I don't :D
